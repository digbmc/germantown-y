# Germantown YWCA: A Social History of a Building
The Germantown YWCA website is a digital scholarship project at Bryn Mawr College, created by the 2024 Digital Scholarship Summer Fellows in collaboration with LITS, Praxis, and Friends for the Restoration of the Germantown YWCA Building. The site was built using [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/)

The aim of the website is to to build a digital exhibition that tells the story of the now-abandoned Germantown YWCA building on Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia. The site is built with interactivity in mind. By utilizing web maps, digital timelines, and digital archives, the site allows users to explore the history of the YWCA in new ways. 

The project is designed with the goal of looking at history in new ways, and an important factor to that is collaboration. The site is designed to be added to.
