description: The building at 5820 Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia once housed the Germantown YWCA Organization and served as a crucial community resource for nearly a century. Subsequently abandoned, it has become the site of a contentious political battle between many different interests including local residents, neighboring agencies and businesses, real estate developers and political agents. This exhibit aims to tell the histories of the building, the Germantown YWCA organization, and the community surrounding it.
