marker_18,YWCA of Germantown “Administration Building”,"Ameer, Isbah",Opened 1915. Occupied until 2005 (Vacant since 2006),"Founded in 1870, the YWCA of Germantown opened its Gothic Revival-style Administration Building at 5820 Germantown Ave. in 1915. Expanded in 1920, it served as a vital community hub for decades. After financial struggles, the board was ousted in 1999 and the renamed Germantown Women’s Y soon closed. Purchased by Germantown Settlement in 2006 with a PRA loan, it never reopened. Fires in 2010 and 2012 followed Settlement’s bankruptcy. As of 2025, PRA has yet to find a redeveloper despite ongoing community advocacy.
