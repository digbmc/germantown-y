From 1974 to 1986, the Center for Older Adults Northwest used the space for daytime exercise and movement classes. The gym included three showers and 20 lockers. In the early 1950s, weekly use included basketball on Monday evenings, a sports club on Wednesday afternoons, and Thursday morning sessions run by L.D.G. Groups using the space regularly contributed to heating and lighting costs. The gym was also used for events like the annual October rummage sale.

This lounge was a central gathering space in the Y. It featured an open fireplace and hosted everything from religious services to community conversations. In the 1950s and ’60s, a semicircular welcome desk near the lounge helped manage entry into the rest of the building.

In 1986, the Y lost its longest and largest tenant when Center for Older Adults moved into their new home next door in the Vernon Park Library. This hastened the financial decline of the Y."
