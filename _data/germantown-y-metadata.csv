March 12, 1928</p>
<p>Dear Miss Bowles:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am enclosing our Branch report for the month of February. In reading over the National Board Report prior to the&nbsp;Sacramento&nbsp;Convention, which by the way, I find I am going to be able to attend, I have been much interested in noticing that so little is said of our Colored Work; even less, in fact, than in the&nbsp;Report to the Milwaukee&nbsp;Convention.</p>
<p>Also, in looking over the tentative program for the Convention sessions, there is no time devoted to our group. I realize perfectly that this exclusiveness is the ideal for which we should strive and that such an&nbsp;attitude&nbsp;has made it possible to go very far in race relations, further, perhaps, than some other organizations.&nbsp;Yet from&nbsp;a local standpoint, we are still working with colored women in Branches, and, perhaps, even for a few years longer there will be Branches; moreover, the whole field of race relations difficulty is not settled as is so often experienced when we feel that we have gone forward and instances of misunderstanding arise.</p>
<p>The whole problem of understanding seems to me so big that I wonder if it is not important enough to have some consideration on Convention Agenda. I realize, however, how tired we all become of race considered over and over, again as a problem just as we do of sex, than focussing attention on one phase. Nevertheless, the working of such a machinery as&nbsp;the&nbsp;Committee on Colored Work&nbsp;-&nbsp;which by the way, we do not have - is so much in the process of flux that, perhaps, some of us could at least gain help from a pooling of experiences and a statement of ideals of race relations.</p>
<p>Our place as an interracial organization in the community is another phase of the same question. Often it is forgotten that we are doing interracial work because we act rather than talk of our activities.</p>
<p>Then, finally, there is membership representation of our group. In other words, these three phases of our problem which I have mentioned, really all have to do with understanding between races. I should like to know if any other Branches feel as we do, the need for a place in the thinking of the Convention.</p>
<p>Hoping to hear from you soon, I am</p>
<p>Very truly yours,</p>
<p>Executive Secretary</p>",

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Activities Secretary is responsible for the promotion of sports particularly badminton, tennis, horseback riding and skating. In addition to this, she is to work as advisor to one Girl Reserve Club, and one Industrial Club. She is responsible for coordination of all sports at the Branch and must be able to work in close cooperation with the Central Y.W.C.A. of Germantown. One problem which the Association has faced is in regard to weekend skating and dancing parties. It has been necessary to establish a name file as a means of checking on the type of persons who attend affairs at the Branch. This condition has perhaps improved some, but is still in the process of being thoroughly worked out. Some attention must be given to the question of the Tennis Courts; which problem may no doubt take a few years in order to be worked out adequately. The presence of the 76th Artillery Unit in this vicinity makes it increasingly important for Industrial girls to have special guidance as to how to accept the presence of the soldiers without becoming fully overwhelmed by them.&nbsp;</p>",

These are to create a “Research Project and Book” for use in the Philadelphia Public School System.

arc_110,,,,YWCA of Germantown 1944 Integration Survey Part 1 & 2,,,,1944,"The image shows photographs of two pages from a questionnaire about segregation and integration of YWCA of Germantown’s facilities (also refer to the Branch YWCA which existed until 1952). It is titled “Questionnaire Used in B&P Council November 1944.” Above the title in pencil, it says “Return to Riegel.” Between the two pages, there are 17 questions and answers (ranging from  simple yes and no’s to why’s with narrative explanations). The first question asks, “Does the YWCA believe in no discrimination against Negroes?” Question 14 asks, “Do you think you are prejudiced against Negroes?” Respondents can be “Administrators” or “Participants.” In this document, “Administrators” likely refers to YWCA staff. The “participants” likely means YWCA club/B&P Council members. (When multiple like-clubs existed, they often had a “council” connecting them.)  In this case, “B&P” likely stands for “Business and Professional” Women, which was a main constituent focus in addition to Industrial Clubs, which were strong in the YWCA’s early decades. The “Business and Professional” women’s clubs included clerical workers, saleswomen, bank tellers, etc. Maggie Kuhn, was the Secretary (YWCA term for Director or Coordinator) of the Business and Professional Women work at the YWCA of Germantown from 1930 to 1941. These surveys were filled out by approximately 27 administrators and 16 participants. Riegel refers to Marguerite L.
