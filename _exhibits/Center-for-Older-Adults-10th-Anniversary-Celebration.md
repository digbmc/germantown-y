On November 10th, 1978, the Center in the Park's 10th anniversary celebration was held at the YWCA, featuring prominent community members and those who were instrumental in shaping the histories of the Center and the YWCA. Highlights included the appearance of Representative David Richardson and the presentation of a framed print of the invitation given to Maggie Kuhn, founder of the Gray Panthers. A paragraph from the Center's annual report that reiterated the Center's philosophy was read:

> The Center program is constantly being updated to meet the current needs and desires of its constituency. The underlying philosophy is to allow the independent elderly to do more than just exist in the community they call home. The Center has created an atmosphere that welcomes older people to share their skills with those less skilled, share their concerns with those less concerned, and share their friendship and love with each other. It is a place where the subliminal societal message of worthlessness given to older people in America is reversed. Instead the attitude that prevails at COA accepts rather than rejects infirmities, gray hair, wrinkling and loneliness as part of normal life process.[^1]
