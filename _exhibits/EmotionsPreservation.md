The Germantown Y once offered a space for women to connect, play, learn, gather together, and watching this community, these women, continuously work to save it shows how rare and treasured it was – is. Since the early 2000s, this building has slowly fallen into disrepair, even since a developer took control in 2016. This story is one of a community fighting to preserve cultural memory and connection, to see their community prosper. It is one of women, primarily aging, refusing to be silenced, demanding that to be heard. Yvonne Haskins, at a PRA meeting in 2021, spoke to the board members, eloquently encapsulating the preservation issues: “I am looking into your eyes and hoping that I am reaching your heart” **(question: do I cite this to the date she told us she said it, or the date that she said it to us?)** .  	 

If this fight to save the Germantown Y conveys anything, it is that preservation is not possible without emotion. While the motivations and connection to this building might be unique for everyone, it is the emotional stake in the space, the neighborhood that provides the strength to keep pushing, after so long. For some, it’s the memories of this space, of what it meant to them, to their children, to their mothers. Others see the impact that revitalizing a (blighted) prominent building could have on uplifting this community. Even others are focused on the accessibility that this building and its parking lot offers. Nostalgia, fear, pride, love: all play a role, and all will determine the future of the Germantown Y.

On February 12, 2025, the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority (PRA) held a public meeting which was attended by several members of the Friends of the Germantown Y. The presence of the attendees, despite the accessibility barriers they had to overcome, spoke volumes. The majority of the women were aging, some disabled, which made attending this meeting particularly difficult. One woman called out the PRA for removing zoom options, explaining that she does not drive, and it would take three buses to attend this meeting, which she was not comfortable doing.  

Attendees of the PRA meeting spoke lengthily about the repeated disappointments they had faced over the course of their pursuit, not to mention the number of their members of Friends of Germantown Y that have passed away since its inception in 2021. They felt that the continued delays and excuses demonstrated a lack of interest, not only in the building, but their voices. Some speakers teared up as they expressed how long they had been waiting for something to be done, waiting for anyone to care half as much as they did.

Cultural memory isn’t the only thing at play here. This building reaches far beyond the Friends of the Germantown Y, or even those who once used it. On October 12, 2023, the former developer, Keith B. Key Enterprises (KBK), held an open community meeting at Center in the Park. When the meeting turned the microphones over those gathered, the thoughts, feelings, and hopes of the neighborhood became abundantly clear.

Most speakers expressed concern over KBK’s plan for the parking lot, which would have blocked the accessible entrance to the Center in the Park, a community center for seniors, thus vastly limiting use of the building. Furthermore, the plan would have made it impossible for vans carrying seniors to the space to turn around, and it would have forced those driving to park at a lot farther away. These needs had already been expressed to KBK by Center in the Park leadership, and yet the designs were shown anyways. The lack of respect for their needs did not sit well with many in the audience, as there were audible negative reactions throughout the course of the meeting and claps and support for those who pushed KBK on the lot.

KBK is no longer the developer for this building, as clarified by the PRA on February 12, 2025. However, this meeting is essential to understanding the breadth of emotions and connections to this building. For those who feel no ties to what the Y once was, the future of this building has the potential to either support the Germantown elderly community, or seriously harm an already vulnerable, often overlooked population.
