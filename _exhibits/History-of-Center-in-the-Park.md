On January 10th, 1986, the Center for Older Adults, Northwest officially moved out of the YWCA building and into their new home at the Vernon Park Library building, embracing its new name of “Center in the Park”[^1]. 

  

While the Center and the Y were physically separated, the two organizations in many ways maintained ongoing diplomacy. In fact, not even a year after the move, the Center and the YWCA came to an agreement on a new ten-year easement, granting the Center the ability to develop handicapped parking and an accessible access route to the new building[^1]. 

  

However, such diplomacy masked a brewing tension between these two organizations that began as the Center planned its move from the YWCA building and only grew stronger after their departure. According to Renée Cunningham, the Center’s Executive Director, the Center greatly helped the cash-strapped YWCA when housed under the same roof. “We were getting money left and right to be able to renovate, build a new elevator, put in a kiln-- all these different things that we did, we brought a lot to the Y,” explained Cunningham[^3]. According to Rennie Cohen, Executive Director of the Center during this period, “we tried very hard in those years when we were in the Y to give the Y as much as we could because their finances were tough”[^2]. 

 

It was known for years before the Center adopted its new home that a departure from the YWCA was imminent, which left “a lot of time for bad blood to brew,” according to Cunningham[^3]. While the Center explored a plan to purchase the YWCA building during this process, their feasibility study showed that the level of renovation required was not financially viable for the Center[^1].  

 

A turning point in this relationship emerged when tensions that had previously been confined to mere “bad blood” began to concretely impact the Center's operations. In the late 1990s, the YWCA explained to the center that they would not renew an easement in the lower parking lot that provided accessible parking and delivery space for the Center. When the easement expired in 2003, the Center had to shepherd people from their parking lot to the building with golf carts, souring relationships further[^3]. The organizations eventually came to terms on a leasing agreement for seven parking spaces in the lower lot after tense mediation. 

 

The true implications of the parking lot fiasco go beyond simply finding accessible parking. Rather, it was a material representation of the way that the Center’s departure from the YWCA building eroded trust between the organizations. Cunningham explained how the inability to renew the easement was part of the fallout of the Center's departure from the YWCA building:

>“There were hurt feelings when we left, and it was probably crippling to them... I really am sure that that's why they had no intentions of moving forward with us or giving us another easement.”[^3]

 

As the Y declared bankruptcy and the fate of the property remains in limbo, the parking lot continues to be a pressing concern for the Center: “It can't be overstated: that parking lot is critical to our operations. Absolutely critical,” declared Cunningham[^3].
