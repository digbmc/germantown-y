The swimming pool played a strong role in the community building that occurred at the YWCA. Due to its integration policies, extensive programming, and outreach, the pool served a large number of Germantown citizens. It also provided fundamental life skills such as swimming lessons, life saving lessons, and lifeguard certification classes. The idea that access to a swimming pool for everyone in the Philadelphia community and beyond may seem almost common now, but back when the pool opened in 1917, it was revolutionary for its time in providing a space for millions to swim through the years. Many hold fond memories of the pool and all of the experiences it provided. Through sharing its history and importance in the Philadelphia community we have collected archival images and oral history excerpts from past employees and members to honor its memory.

This is an excerpt from a pamphlet given out at the opening week of the YWCA’s new administration building (1917) that features goals set by the branch in how they want the pool to be used. This includes the mission to develop “strength” and “self-reliance and courage” in young women as well as instilling “good carriage and poise.” This also includes information about the shared swimsuits and rules for swimmers.

In this brochure from the YWCA, we see the dates, employees, times, and plans for the pool in the year of 2000. Additionally, the pamphlet discusses the importance of children learning how to swim, especially for “minority” children, as it is one of the highest causes of death at the time of this being published. As they say in the pamphlet “almost anyone who has lived in Germantown learned to swim in this pool,” showing that its need in the community is felt by many. Comparing this to the 1917 pamphlet above, we can see that these values held by the Y were unwavering for close to a century.

As seen in the image above, children in uniform swimsuits are taking part in swim lessons. This photo is from June 14th, 1966, and was utilized as publicity for the day camp that the YWCA housed. At this point in history, the YWCA had been an integrated space since 1946, a distinct and notable element of the organization, as they were on the forefront of the movement for integration. Women and children of all races shared the pool, and took part in programming that promoted women's advancement of opportunity in society. The act of learning to swim is one of privilege as it can be hard to locate and pay for swim lessons. The YWCA serviced middle class, working class Philadelphians, and it was only one of few public, indoor swimming pools this demographic had access to.

This photo above is revolutionary for its time, as integrated swimming classes were almost unheard of. This exemplifies the YWCA’s long standing support for inclusivity and uplifting of minority communities, and further displays the importance that the space held. As seen in this photo, a majority of the students are teens, and the YWCA put a large emphasis on creating empowering programming for young women of all races. Not only were there significant efforts for women to learn and engage in swimming, but the YWCA also offered the opportunity to become a lifeguard.

This photograph displays the various swimming programming that were available, including the option to enroll in life saving courses. It also includes the written detail that the pool provides sterilized swimwear.



**Oral History Quotes About the Pool, Fall of 2023:**

**An interview with Arleen Olshan, the former art director at the Y, about her experience with using the pool as a space to meet other LGBTQ women:**

**Arleen Olshen:** One thing I should tell you, too, that the pool, the swimming pool? On Tuesday nights, back in the day, when we were part of Radicalesbians, like in the 1970s, early 1970s, there was nude swimming there on Tuesday nights. 

**Grace Roebuck:** Just for women? 

**Arleen Olshen:** Just for women. And it was wonderful. I mean, we'd all be with our towels, and everything was really cool, and we'd all hang out. And it was both Lesbian and Straight women that went and maybe there would be like, 20 women there every Tuesday night, and it was fabulous! That Y was wonderful back in the day and it would be great to see it open again. It really would.

**Grace Roebuck:** That sounds amazing. Yeah.

**Arleen Olshen:** It's very important to gain access to it, and find out exactly what needs to be done. I mean, it's not just like, let's just unlock the doors and open the windows.  I know that there's all kinds of water damage and probably needs a new roof. The pool was falling apart back in the day, the floors were buckling. There's a lot of work to be done. If you can't get access, you can't know what the hell needs to be done.


**An interview with Lyn Thompson Giles, TITLE, about how hard it got to upkeep of the pool and fond memories:**

**Lyn Thompson Giles:** I remember getting a huge grant to refurbish some of the swimming pool because there was some fancy guy who had designed a swimming pool, but it was $400,000 which should have been enough. But it wasn't, I mean, it only took care of heating the pool. So the pool still needs to be cleaned. The pool still needs to be painted. 
  
It was such a fabulous place to be from when I was a young girl to right before it closed. Because we used to have, in the summer, the kids would come to go swimming because there wasn't a lot of outdoor pools, but you know, it was $1.50 to go swimming, and most people could afford $1.50 at that time. But then people would steal pipes. And it was just, it was just never enough money. 

**An interview with Ann Perrone, TITLE, where she shares her visual memories of the pool:**

**Ann Perrone:** I remember the smell of the swimming pool. You could smell the swimming pool as soon as you entered the front door. The swimming pool was down in the basement, it was under the gym, basically. And that sort of hot, humid chlorine smell. In my head, I see the pool. There's not enough pools. Now, it's not an Olympic sized pool. It's not, you know, it's not as big as the pool at the YMCA. It's not like the Kroc Center, which has this gigantic pool, you know, it's fine, whatever. But all those different rooms… I don't believe in ghosts. But if there were ghosts, the ghosts of the, of the people who created art, and who put on plays and had community dinners, and you know, all those, all the songs we used to sing and all the campers and all the tennis players and all the swimmers and all this synchronized swimming- which evidently is coming back, it's like an Olympic- 

**Grace Roebuck:** It's an Olympic sport. 

**Ann Perrone:** Right? I can remember synchronized swimming. I didn't do it. But they had synchronized swimming, and you'd have a performance and people would come and sit at the side of the pool and watch the ladies go *mimes synchronized swimmers and sings* ‘Ah dah dah dah!’

This photo displays the pool after the YWCA was closed. The pool is drained and abandoned, and is filled with garbage. The windows in the background are boarded up, and the whole building generally appears dilapidated. Although there are copious amounts of repairs that would need to be done, the pool’s tiling and overall structure remains intact.
