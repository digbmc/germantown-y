## *Dinah*:
Dinah was a Black woman who is known for her bravery and quick wits to save the Stenton House from being burned by British Soldiers during the Revolutionary War. When Dinah was a young girl, she was given to Hannah Emlen as a gift. Hannah Emlen eventually married William Logan and became his property through the dowry process, moving Dinah from Emlen’s estate to the Stenton Plantation. Although Dinah is mainly known for saving the Stenton property, there is much more to Dinah’s story. She had a husband, whom she advocated for the Logan’s to purchase so they could be together, and together they had a daughter. Later she would become a grandmother. Dinah had advocated for her own freedom, and was emancipated on April 15th, 1776. She continued to work on the Stenton Plantation as a paid servant. It was during this period of her life when she saved the Stenton Mansion from being burned and destroyed by British Soldiers. To learn more about Dinah visit https://www.stenton.org/dinah
