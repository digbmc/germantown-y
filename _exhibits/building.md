## Description of 6128 Germantown Ave.

The Germantown YWCA owned multiple buildings. The main one, often called the Administrative Building, was located at 5820 Germantown Avenue and hosted the main YWCA. The Colored Branch was located in a building at 6128 Germantown Avenue. The two buildings are often referred to by their street numbers: ‘5820’ and ‘6128’.  

The property at 6128 Germantown Ave for the Colored Branch was approximately 40 x 125 feet large, containing a relatively large, three story building, a lot behind it, a terrace, and tennis courts. The building itself contained a variety of rooms, which included a living room, blue room, kitchen, third floor front and kitchen, club room, and a gymnasium. Unlike the 5820 building, they did not have a pool. Their spaces were used to host a variety of activities, including private parties, church groups, meetings, teas and receptions. Many of these spaces, including the tennis courts, were rented out for outside groups to use. The image below is a photograph of a list of their “house equipment” which included dishes, glasses, linens, roller skates, and music equipment.

In a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVVQdut2pCA) for the project, Germantown Speaks, old members reflect on their positive experiences with the building: 

“it was a wonderful building, we never had to feel like we were deprived or separated because our building was lovely, we had no complaints because it was a handsome building” (02:42-02:52) 

“we also had the best tennis court there in Philadelphia. It was made of cork and everyone came there for their summer parties” (00:45-00:57) 

Requests and work for improvement was constantly being done throughout the years. Since the Colored Branch was a branch of the main Germantown YWCA, it had to gain approval as well as funds for changes. It is unclear what exactly the nature of this relationship was, however, the power was in favor of the main YWCA. A report from the 10th of January, 1945 complains about the poor state of the building:  

>“With the exception of two rooms, the office and the gym, this three story building of twelve rooms and four halls has not been redecorated or refurnished in more than ten years ... The building as a whole is much worse because of constant use in an effort to meet new trends and needs for community service ... shabby and inadequately furnished in the beginning ... impossible to carry on a satisfactory summer program in the building during the hottest months.” (Temple Archives, Box 24.2. Building Correspondence 1926-55).  

The report also included a request for additional funds of a total of $2,229.00 to redecorate and refurnish multiple rooms in the building. Some sections were left blank, however, so it is unclear if the request was ever sent.   

It appears that the building was not kept in good condition, especially towards the end, and therefore lost value. The main YWCA claimed that it did not have the funds to continue the maintenance of the building and therefore had to sell it, despite protest and pushback from the Colored Branch. Because of the building’s important role as the home of the Colored Branch and a focal point for the Germantown Black community, many members fought to keep it. So, while some saw the closing of the 6128 building as a “triumph” for integration, others did not share this sentiment. For them, this event was tragic and became “deeply ingrained in the mind of Germantown's Black community” (Felix, 1999, 217), in fact, some Black women refused to set foot in the YWCA afterwards. Thus, the integration of the Colored Branch and the closing of the 6128 building was a complicated issue that was both applauded and criticized by Black and white members from both YWCA’s. 

An appraisal of the building from 1952 lists the building as being worth $26,500, and the land as $30,000 for a total sum of $56,500. The appraisal recommends that, since the building is not as valuable as the land, it be torn down and converted into parking. The YWCA did not follow this advice and instead searched for someone who would buy and keep the building. In 1953 they received a request from the Y*M*CA on Rittenhouse Street to consider them as potential buyers. Despite initial interest the YWCA ultimately turned them down because “in view of the committments that the YWCA has made to the community as well as to its constituents, we felt it advisable not to sell to an agency community supported as we were, whose programme is set up on a segregated basis” (Temple Archives, Box 24/3). On January 26th, 1955, the 6128 building was sold to the Philadelphia Turners Association. Shortly thereafter, it was sold again to the Settlement Music School, who are still located there today. The building now also has a historic designation marker for one of it's members, Ora Washington, who was a famous tennis player ([read more here](https://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-35A)).
