# Introduction 

Home to many historical and significant properties, Germantown also has the pleasure of being home to **Center in the Park**. Originally called the Center for Older Adults, the grassroots senior center began in 1968 and was located in the Germantown YWCA building. 

A neighborhood that had always been progressive for its time and revolutionary in its ideals and goals, Germantown was a hub for reimagining what aging meant during the 70s and 80s. As the needs of aging citizens grew, so did the conversations around community, independence, and dignity for older adults. One prominent advocate for this was Maggie Kuhn, Germantown resident, activist, and founder of the Gray Panthers. She is known for raising public awareness surrounding challenges of aging populations like isolation and mental health and often pointing out the inadequacies of nursing homes at the time.  

One YWCA member, Anita Foeman, shared her own experience meeting Kuhn, Anita remembers hearing Kuhn speak at First United Methodist Church: "She seemed like this little old lady with a bun on top of her head... in this bright purple dress and her heels!" 

What stood out most was Kuhn's radical message of challenging passive roles often assigned to seniors: "Why do we have old people making baskets? Let’s have them gardening, getting fresh vegetables." For Anita and others, Kuhn made aging feel dynamic and full of potential. She inspired a rethinking of what community spaces could offer. 

The potential for communal spaces for aging populations was made a reality in the Germantown Y. Here, the Center for Older Adults was established. As Renée Cunningham, the Center’s current Executive Director, explains, "There were parts of the building that the Y didn’t even use that, as we were growing, they then all of a sudden could use.” Within a year, the Center had set up two art classes, a sewing class, bible study, and two lunch programs sponsored by the First Presbyterian Church and the NW Lutheran Synod. As the years passed, art shows, fashion shows, and luncheons were hosted. Health resources and events, like weekly mental health group discussions, were made possible. The YWCA offered fitness programs to the Center’s members and many used the pool. In 1973, the Center would become one of the first 13 federally funded nutrition sites in Philadelphia.

Cunningham recalls, "We were getting money left and right to be able to renovate." Funding for the program steadily increased over the years, too, providing important financial support to the Y building’s physical needs. The Center secured funding from the Philadelphia Corporation for Aging and fundraising that allowed for key renovations. “Build a new elevator, put in a kiln-- all these different things that we did, we brought a lot to the Y. We tried very hard in those years when we were in the Y to give the Y as much as we could because their finances were tough.” 

Long-time community members fondly remember the Center's programs that once thrived in the YWCA building. One such member, Lyn, having had three generations of participation in the Y, had much to recall. Among her memories was an incident with the elevator: "Oh yeah, we had an elevator that people would get stuck in all the time… everything about that building was old, old." Another member, Desiree, recalled her own experience with the infamous elevator: "Being at the Y is where my claustrophobia was born!" Against her mother’s warning, she entered the elevator only to get stuck. The fire department had to rescue her. “It was a whole thing,” she laughed.  

Despite the infrastructural limitations that marked the Center's tenure in the YWCA building, Germantown residents and members of the YWCA cherish their memories of the Center's programming. On November 10, 1978, the Center’s 10th Anniversary Party was held at the YWCA. House of Representatives member David Richardson and life-long resident of Germantown made an appearance, as well as Maggie Kuhn.
