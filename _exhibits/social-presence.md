The YWCA at 5820 Germantown Avenue was much more than just a building—it became a space where strong social connections were built, offering support to both members and non-members alike. 

Through letters and reports, it’s clear how the YWCA fostered relationships within the organization and with the wider community.Even in formal communications, there is a sense of warmth and personal connection. Staff members and representatives from other organizations often shared updates about their lives, including weekend recaps or special events. These exchanges weren’t just about logistics—they reflected the deep bonds the YWCA fostered within its community. The YWCA’s support extended far beyond its direct services. Even after it stopped offering accommodations, the organization remained dedicated to helping those in need by connecting them with the right resources. Letters reveal that visitors from across the country (and Canada) would reach out requesting a place to stay. When the YWCA could no longer host them, they went the extra mile, referring them to members' homes and providing contact information to ensure safety and comfort. Visitors were also encouraged to stop by the YWCA to connect and engage, fostering a welcoming sense of community. 

The physical space of the building further reinforced this sense of connection. With areas dedicated to both educational and social activities, the YWCA provided a variety of spaces for community engagement. The Club Room and Board Room hosted millinery and sewing classes, while the reading room served as a gathering spot for women and their families. These rooms encouraged learning, mutual support, and a sense of belonging. 

The gymnasium, which regularly hosted basketball games and sports clubs, was not just a place for fitness but for fostering camaraderie. The lounge was used for large gatherings, religious services, and social events, creating a welcoming space for the community to come together. Whether through classes, cooking demonstrations, sports, or social events, these spaces were designed to bring people together. 

From heartfelt letters to shared spaces for education, recreation, and collaboration, the YWCA in Germantown created a culture of care, connection, and support. Its legacy highlights the importance of friendship, guidance, and the power of community.

## About the Architects
The original structure and design of 5820 Germantown Ave was designed by architecture firm Harris & Rush Architects in 1914, by James Russell Harris and Louis Harold Rush. The two collaborated through their private practice for a short time, from 1912 to 1915. 

Harris was born in Philadelphia, attended the Friends’ Central School and received his B.S. in Architecture from Harvard University in 1896 before working as a draftsman for Frank Miles Day & Bro. Prior to the formation of Harris & Rush, he was a partner at Newman, Woodman, & Harris. 

Rush was born in Rye Beach, New Hampshire and received his B.S. in Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania in 1901. He spent two years studying in Paris before returning back to the U.S. and joined the firm Newman & Harris (where he met Harris). Their office was located at 130 S. 15th Street in Philadelphia.
