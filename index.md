You will know you’ve arrived at the Germantown YWCA at 5820 Germantown Avenue when you see the “Women of Germantown” mural on the 4-story, red brick building extending into Vernon Park. It was designed by Louis Rush, opened in 1915 and historically designated in 1984. Twenty years vacant, it has survived years of failed government stewardship, fires and a demolition threat. The Young Women’s Christian Association of Germantown, founded in 1870, owned and occupied the building until 1999. As much a social movement as a service organization, they were early leaders in the empowerment of women and girls, workplace organizing, race relations and civil rights. Thanks to Germantown women, past and present, the iconic building still stands.

This nascent website evolved from a partnership begun in 2022 between the Praxis Office of Bryn Mawr College and Friends for the Restoration of the Germantown YWCA Building, an all-volunteer advocacy group. Other college departments, faculty and staff soon became involved, guiding students to build site infrastructure, conduct research and oral histories and create content. As an ongoing platform, the site preserves, records and sustains memories of the YWCA building, organization and community, encourages research and demonstrates the building’s continued social and cultural relevance. The site tells stories about the past and chronicles ongoing efforts to repurpose the building in keeping with community needs and the YWCA’s rich history.
