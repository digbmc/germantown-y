## About the Project 

**Land Acknowledgement:** The work for this project was largely conducted at Bryn Mawr College. The land on which Bryn Mawr College and Germantown YWCA stand on is part of the ancestral homeland and territory of the Lenape people. We openly recognize the Lenape Indian tribe as the original inhabitants of eastern Pennsylvania. We acknowledge the Lenape people as the indigenous stewards of their homelands and also the spiritual keepers of the Lenape Sippu, or Delaware River, and we do hereby commit to actively supporting our Lenape [siblings] in whatever way we are able, helping to maintain the cultural identity of Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and southern New York.


The Germantown YWCA: A Social History of a Building is an ongoing project aiming to preserve Germantown’s rich history and share the stories of its residents, creating an interactive website to educate people about ‘the Y’ and provide a place of comfort for the Friends of Germantown. 

First, led by Prof. Min Kyung Lee, working with the Praxis Program, continued its project with the Digital Scholarship Department to curate a website. The website provides background information on the social, political, and historical aspects of Germantown. It includes digital representations of the building's architectural plans, a timeline for significant events, a map of the Germantown neighborhood that highlights associated buildings, and visual aids to present the neighborhood's development over the years.

### How it started/process
This project springs out of an ongoing collaboration between the Praxis Program, the Cities Department, and Friends of the Germantown YWCA, a local volunteer advocacy group working for a community-based solution to the building, co-founded by Yvonne B. Haskins and Ann Doley. 

Bryn Mawr students and faculty involved in two previous Praxis courses have conducted research, including oral histories and archival research, to detail the history of this unique space and the community around it. The students collected files and important history for the Digital Scholarship Summer Fellows (DSSFs) to take on the project.

Starting in June 2024, 5 DSSFs, who were recruited during Spring 2024 began learning relevant technologies to the project with workshops held by the LITS and EAST department for the first two weeks. The DSSFs all had diverse backgrounds and shared a drive to design accessible and useful web publishing that enhances awareness. Each one had relevant past experiences working with various technologies. Working closely with Min Lee, Liv Raddatz (Praxis), Ann Doley, Renee Cunningham and other community stakeholders, our team designed and built the infrastructure of the website. 

During the summer, fellows collaborated to build a digital exhibition to tell the history of the now-abandoned Germantown YWCA building on Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia. Throughout the process, the fellows gained experience in data management and visualization, mapping, git and digital publishing. They had the opportunity to visit the local organization, communicate with the Germantown YWCA stakeholders, and hold weekly meetings with Ann and Renee. These opportunities allowed them to gain more insight into the history and upbringing of the building and organization. It made the work seem real. 

During fall 2024, the DSSFs, who evolved into Digital Scholarship Project Assistants continued working on the project. Starting spring 2025, they collaborated with a Praxis Course. The Praxis Course students worked towards curating content for the website, providing relevant information to publish on the website. 

## Site Development
The Germantown YWCA: A Social History of a Building website was built using CollectionBuilder as a template for the site. CollectionBuilder is a Jekyll-based framework for hosting digital archives. Jekyll is a static site generator. To edit the site, we used HTML, CSS, SCSS, Ruby, and JavaScript languages. 

For convenient collaboration, we utilized GitHub, a platform for hosting projects that uses Git, an open-source version control tool that allows people to work with different versions of a project together. The Germantown YWCA Website is hosted and deployed using GitHub and Jekyll. 

For the timeline, CSS was used to change the visuals components and edit the JSON file to read in some data to enable features of the timeline made from Knight Lab’s TimelineJS, an open-source tool that enables the ability to build visually rich, interactive timelines using a Google spreadsheet. The floorplan map and web map use Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. To get the coordinates of a specific room in the floorplan map, we used an image mapping tool called Image Map Generator. All these interactive elements use a CSV file to store relevant information.
