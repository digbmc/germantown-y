## About the Project 

**Land Acknowledgement:** The work for this project was largely conducted at Bryn Mawr College. The land on which Bryn Mawr College and Germantown YWCA stand on is part of the ancestral homeland and territory of the Lenape people. We openly recognize the Lenape Indian tribe as the original inhabitants of eastern Pennsylvania. We acknowledge the Lenape people as the indigenous stewards of their homelands and also the spiritual keepers of the Lenape Sippu, or Delaware River, and we do hereby commit to actively supporting our Lenape [siblings] in whatever way we are able, helping to maintain the cultural identity of Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and southern New York.


The Germantown YWCA: A Social History of a Building is an ongoing project aiming to preserve Germantown’s rich history and share the stories of its residents, creating an interactive website to educate people about ‘the Y’ and provide a place of comfort for the Friends of Germantown. 

First, led by Prof. Min Kyung Lee, working with the Praxis Program, continued its project with the Digital Scholarship Department to curate a website. The website provides background information on the social, political, and historical aspects of Germantown. It includes digital representations of the building's architectural plans, a timeline for significant events, a map of the Germantown neighborhood that highlights associated buildings, and visual aids to present the neighborhood's development over the years.
