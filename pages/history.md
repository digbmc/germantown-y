## History


## About Germantown
The YWCA building at 5820 Germantown Avenue was founded as part of the broader YWCA movement. Dating back to 1915, the building served as a safe space for Black and white women in Germantown. Over the years, the building has offered various programs such as educational classes on vocational training, health and wellness, civic engagement and leadership, home economics, and many more. The building was a space to empower women and the community.

Not only was it a place for educational courses, but The Germantown YWCA provided a space for meetings and gatherings related to the civil rights movement. It served as a venue for discussions, planning sessions, and community organizing efforts.

The building has sat vacant for a few years now and developers have been working to redevelop the Germantown YWCA into affordable housing.

### Construction of Building
The historic Germantown YWCA was designed by Louis H. Rush.
