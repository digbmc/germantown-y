# Oral Histories

As part of the siteâ€™s goal to preserve the stories of the YWCA building as well as to support continued research on the building and its social history, several oral histories of former members and residents were conducted by Bryn Mawr and Haverford College students. We are working with the Germantown Historical Society to process and archive these narratives. Excerpts from those interviews will be exhibited on this page. If you are interested in being interviewed, please [contact Professor Min Kyung Lee](mailto:mlee9@brynmawr.edu).
